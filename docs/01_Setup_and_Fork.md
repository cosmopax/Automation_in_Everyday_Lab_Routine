# Phase 1: Setup & Forking

## 1. Create a GitHub Account
If you do not have one, go to [github.com](https://github.com/signup) and create an account.
* **Tip:** Choose a professional username (e.g., \`p.schimpl\` is better than \`chem_wizard_99\`).
* **Verification:** Verify your email address to ensure you can commit code.

## 2. Install Tools
You need two things on your laptop:
1.  **VS Code:** A code editor. [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  **Git:** The version control software.
    * **Windows:** [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    * **Mac:** Open Terminal and type \`git --version\`. If it asks to install "Command Line Tools," say Yes.

## 3. "Fork" the Repository
You cannot write directly to the Professor's repository. You need your own copy.
1.  Go to the [Course Repository](https://github.com/cosmopax/Automation_in_Everyday_Lab_Routine).
2.  Look at the top-right corner for the button **Fork**.
3.  Click **Fork** -> **Create a new fork**.
4.  Leave the name as is and click **Create fork**.

*Result:* You now have a copy at \`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Automation_in_Everyday_Lab_Routine\`.

# Flow Chem Calculator 3000
This program aims to simplify flow chemistry setups by assisting with needed calculations. It has two main functions:

### 1. Calculate Reactor Property
Quick and easy reactor property calculation! Volume, Length, or Diameter, provide two and get the third one.

### 2. Calculations for a full set up
This lets you define reactors and syringes, connect them as needed and then calculate the Volume, Flow Rates or Retention Time.

## Requirements
The only requirement is something that can run python, has a screen and a keyboard for inputs.

## Use
Save the file and run it in the files direcotry with
```bash
python flowchemcalculator3000.py
````
The program will provide all needed information to use it. By simply reading what it says it should be easy to use.

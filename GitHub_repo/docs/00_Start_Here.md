# Why Git?

**"Why can't I just email my files?"**

Great question. In modern science and engineering, we rarely work alone, and we rarely get things right on the first try.

**Git** is a tool for **Version Control**. It allows us to:
1.  **Track Changes:** See exactly what changed, when, and by whom. No more `final_v2_REALLY_FINAL.docx`.
2.  **Collaborate:** Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other.
3.  **Backup:** Your work is safely stored in the cloud (GitHub).

In this course, we use Git not just to submit homework, but to practice the standard workflow used by data scientists and software engineers worldwide.

## 🛠️ The "Zero-Friction" Setup Tool

To avoid naming errors, **do not create folders manually.**
We provide a Python wizard (`setup_submission.py`) that generates the strict folder structure required for grading.

**Usage:**

1. Open your terminal inside the repository folder.
2. Run the wizard:

```bash
python3 setup_submission.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to set up your Group Protocol or Capstone Project folder.

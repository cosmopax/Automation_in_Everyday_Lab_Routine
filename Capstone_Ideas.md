# 💡 Capstone Project Inspiration

Stuck on what to do for Module 8? Here are some ideas to get your creativity flowing. Remember, you can choose **ONE** of the three tracks.

## 🐍 Track A: Code (Software Automation)
*Build a tool that saves time.*

1.  **Automated Colorimeter using a Webcam**
    *   **Concept:** Use a standard webcam and Python (OpenCV) to track the color change of a reaction in real-time and determine the endpoint.
    *   **Tech:** Python, OpenCV.

2.  **Log Parser for SpectroVis**
    *   **Concept:** Write a script that automatically ingests raw `.txt` or `.csv` files from the Vernier SpectroVis, cleans the data, and plots the absorbance vs. time.
    *   **Tech:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

3.  **Inventory Bot**
    *   **Concept:** A simple command-line tool or chatbot where you can query "Where is the Sodium Chloride?" and it returns the shelf location.
    *   **Tech:** Python, SQLite/JSON.

## ⚙️ Track B: System Design (The Architect)
*Plan the lab of the future.*

1.  **The Self-Cleaning Manifold**
    *   **Concept:** Design a flow chemistry setup that includes a dedicated solvent flush line and valve switching logic to clean the reactor between runs automatically.
    *   **Output:** P&ID (Diagram) + Valve Selection.

2.  **3D Printed Fraction Collector**
    *   **Concept:** Design a mechanical system (rotary or XY-stage) that moves vials under a dispensing nozzle to collect fractions from a column or flow reactor.
    *   **Output:** CAD Sketches + Motor Selection (Stepper/Servo).

3.  **Emergency Shutdown Circuit**
    *   **Concept:** Design a hard-wired safety circuit that cuts power to pumps and heaters if a pressure sensor triggers or a leak is detected.
    *   **Output:** Circuit Diagram + Component List.

## 📚 Track C: Theoretical Research (The Analyst)
*Think deeply about the impact.*

1.  **The Economics of Flow vs. Batch**
    *   **Question:** Analyze the capital and operating costs of converting a specific pharmaceutical process (e.g., Ibuprofen) from batch to continuous flow. Where is the break-even point?
    *   **Output:** Economic Analysis Review.

2.  **AI in Drug Discovery: A Critical Review**
    *   **Question:** "Hallucinating Molecules." Review the current state of Generative AI in medicinal chemistry. What are the promises, and what are the failure modes?
    *   **Output:** Critical Review Paper.

3.  **The History of Laboratory Automation**
    *   **Question:** Trace the lineage of automation from the first auto-titrators to the modern "Self-Driving Lab." How has the role of the chemist changed?
    *   **Output:** Historical Review.

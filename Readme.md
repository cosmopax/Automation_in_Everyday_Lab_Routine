# Automation in Everyday Laboratory Routine (WS 25/26)

**Course Vision:** "Topoi of the Imminent."
We are training chemists to be architects of automation, not manual operators.

## Resources
The `code_examples/` directory contains the essential drivers and templates for your work:
*   `poseidon_driver.py`: Python driver for the Open Source Poseidon syringe pumps.
*   `capstone_template.py`: Boilerplate code for your individual capstone projects.

## Submission Protocol (CRITICAL)
We have simplified the workflow. All submissions must be pushed directly to the `main` branch in the designated folder.

**Target Path:** [`students_deliverables/25WS/`](https://github.com/cosmopax/Automation_in_Everyday_Lab_Routine/tree/main/students_deliverables/25WS)

### Folder Naming Rules
Strict adherence to these naming conventions is required for the automated grading pipeline.

1.  **Group Protocols:**
    *   Format: `25WS_Protocol_LastName_FirstName_of_all_members`
    *   *Example:* `25WS_Protocol_Doe_John_Smith_Jane`

2.  **Individual Capstone Projects:**
    *   Format: `25WS_LastName_FirstName_OptionX_Title`
    *   *Example:* `25WS_Doe_John_OptionA_AutomatedTitration`

**Note:** Ensure your code is well-commented and includes a `requirements.txt` if you use non-standard libraries.

## 📅 Your Semester Workflow

### PHASE 1: SETUP
**Do this once at the beginning of the semester.**
You need a GitHub account and a local copy of this repository to submit your work.

👉 **[Read the Setup Guide](docs/01_Setup_and_Fork.md)**

---

### PHASE 2: SUBMISSION
**Do this when you are ready to hand in a protocol or your Capstone.**
We use a standard folder structure to keep things organized.

**1. Create your folder**
We have provided a tool to help you. Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 setup_submission.py
```
It will generate your personal folder in `students_deliverables/`.

**2. Submit your work**
Move your files into that folder and push them to the cloud.

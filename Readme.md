Dear Students

## Repository Structure (25WS+)

This repository contains the materials and programming projects for the course  
**“Automation in Everyday Lab Routine” (Master level, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna).**

Top-level layout on the `main` branch:

- `materials/` – Lab manual and course handouts.
- `supportive_media/` – Example scripts, templates, and useful links.
- `sandbox/` – Free experimental space for trying out code.
- `courses_projects/` – Student project submissions per semester:
  - `courses_projects/25SS/`
  - `courses_projects/25WS/`
  - `courses_projects/26SS/`
  - `courses_projects/26WS/`

Each student project for a given semester lives in a single folder inside the respective semester directory, named as:

`yearsemester_Lastname_Firstname_ProjectTitle`

Example: `25SS_Fischer_Patrick_MeSciA`

Detailed instructions are provided in `materials/Programming_Assignment_Guide.md` (to be added) and in the course manual.
